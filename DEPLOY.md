# Deploying UniSwap

Everything below uses free tiers. Do the steps in this order: each one gives you a value the next
one needs. **Never commit any of these keys.** They go into the Render and Vercel dashboards (and your
local `backend/.env`, which git ignores).

| Piece | Service | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Database | Supabase | `DATABASE_URL` |
| Photos | Cloudinary | `CLOUDINARY_*` |
| API (`backend/`) | Render | `https://uniswap-api-xxxx.onrender.com` |
| Website (`frontend/`) | Vercel | `https://your-app.vercel.app` |
| Card payments (test mode) | Stripe | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| Telegram alerts | @BotFather | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` |
| Email | Gmail App Password | `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` |

Each optional service (Cloudinary, Stripe, Telegram, email) stays switched off until its keys are set.
When the API starts, its log shows which ones are on, e.g.
`email on · photos Cloudinary · payments on · Telegram off`.

## 1. Database: Supabase

1. Go to supabase.com → **New project**. Pick region **Southeast Asia (Singapore)** and save the
   database password somewhere safe.
2. Click **Connect** (top of the project page) → **Session pooler** → copy the URI. It looks like
   `postgresql://postgres.abcd:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`.
   Use the session pooler, not "Direct connection": Render cannot reach Supabase's direct address.
3. Put your password in, and add `?sslmode=no-verify` at the end. (The connection is still
   encrypted; this only skips checking Supabase's certificate, which Node does not ship with.)
4. Create the tables and demo data from your laptop:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   export DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres.abcd:PASSWORD@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=no-verify'
   npm run db:setup && npm run db:seed
   unset DATABASE_URL
   ```
   A variable set in the terminal overrides the one in `.env`, so this only affects these commands.
   After this, Supabase's **Table Editor** shows the tables and lets you edit rows by hand.

## 2. Photos: Cloudinary

Sign up at cloudinary.com. The dashboard's **API Keys** page shows your **Cloud name**, **API key**
and **API secret**. Without Cloudinary, photos are saved on the server's disk, and Render wipes that
disk on every restart.

## 3. API: Render

1. Push your branch to GitHub first (Render deploys from GitHub).
2. render.com → **New** → **Blueprint** → connect GitHub → pick the repository and branch. Render
   reads `render.yaml` and creates the `uniswap-api` service.
3. Fill in the values it asks for. Leave `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` as `http://localhost:3000` for now (you
   get the real value in step 4). Leave Stripe and Telegram empty if you have not set them up yet.
4. When the deploy finishes, open `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/api/health`. It should show
   `{"status":"ok"}`.

The free plan sleeps after 15 minutes without visitors, and the first request after that takes
about a minute. While it sleeps, ended auctions are closed and Telegram messages are picked up as
soon as it wakes. Bids are always refused after the end time.

## 4. Website: Vercel

1. vercel.com → **Add New** → **Project** → import the same repository.
2. Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`. This is important, because the repo has two apps.
3. Under **Environment Variables** add `API_URL` = your Render URL (no trailing slash).
4. Deploy. Copy the site's URL, then go back to Render → **Environment** → set `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`
   to it. Render redeploys. Links in emails and Telegram now point to the live site.

## 5. Card payments: Stripe (test mode)

1. Create a Stripe account. Test mode works straight away, and you never need to activate live payments.
2. **Developers → API keys** → copy the **Secret key** (`sk_test_...`) into Render as
   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`. The API refuses live keys (`sk_live_...`), so a real card can never be charged.
3. **Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint**: URL `https://<your-render-url>/api/payments/webhook`,
   event `checkout.session.completed`. Copy its **Signing secret** (`whsec_...`) into Render as
   `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. The webhook catches buyers who pay and then close the tab before
   returning to UniSwap.
4. To try it: buy an item for sale, or win an auction. Click **Pay with card**, then use card
   `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry date and any CVC. Afterwards the item shows as sold.

Locally, only `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is needed: the listing page confirms the payment when Stripe
sends the buyer back.

## 6. Telegram alerts

1. In Telegram, message **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → choose a name and a username ending in `bot`.
2. Put the token in `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and the username (without `@`) in `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`.
3. Users connect in **Settings → Notifications → Connect Telegram**, then press **Start** in the bot.

Only one running copy of the API can listen to a bot. If you test locally with the same token
while Render is running, one of them will log polling errors, so use a second bot for local testing.

## 7. Email: Gmail

School Outlook accounts cannot send email from apps. Use a Gmail account:

1. Turn on 2-Step Verification.
2. Go to Google Account → Security → **App passwords** and create one.
3. Set `SMTP_USER` to the Gmail address and `SMTP_PASS` to the 16-character app password.
   Recipients can still be `.edu.kh`.

## Checklist

- [ ] `https://<render-url>/api/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`
- [ ] The Render log shows the services you expect switched on
- [ ] The Vercel site lists the demo listings (so the database and `API_URL` are right)
- [ ] Register with a `.edu.kh` email, receive the verification email, and log in
- [ ] Post a listing with a photo: the image URL starts with `https://res.cloudinary.com/`
- [ ] Pay for an item with the test card: it becomes sold, and the seller and buyer get emails
