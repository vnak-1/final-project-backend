# UniSwap Backend

REST API for UniSwap, built with **Node.js + Express 5 + PostgreSQL**, as described in the
project proposal (Section 4, Methodology).

## Setup

Requires Node.js 20.6+ and PostgreSQL 13+ (local, or a free Supabase database).

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then edit DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET
npm run db:setup          # creates the tables (drops existing data!)
npm run db:seed           # optional demo data; every demo user's password is "password123"
npm run dev               # http://localhost:4000, restarts on file changes
npm test                  # unit tests (Node's built-in test runner)
```

Check it works: `curl http://localhost:4000/api/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`

### Verification emails (optional)

Set `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER` and `SMTP_PASS` in `.env` (see `.env.example`) to email
the verification link when someone registers. Until then, the link is printed in the server log.

- **School Outlook / Microsoft 365:** `smtp.office365.com`, port `587`, your normal password. Only
  works if the school allows "SMTP AUTH" for your mailbox; Microsoft is phasing it out.
- **Gmail:** `smtp.gmail.com`, port `465`, with a Google App Password (needs 2-Step Verification).

Check the settings with `npm run email:test -- you@university.edu.kh`. It logs in, sends one test
email, and prints the mail server's reply if something is refused.

## Database

Tables follow the ER diagram in the proposal (Figure 2): `users`, `listings`, `messages`,
`reviews`. See [`src/db/schema.sql`](src/db/schema.sql). Allowed values are enforced twice, in
the API (`utils/validation.js`) and in the database (`CHECK` constraints):

- **category:** textbooks, electronics, furniture, clothing, bikes, other
- **condition:** new, like_new, good, fair
- **listing type:** sale, buy_request, trade, giveaway, auction
- **status:** active, reserved, sold, traded

### Search

`GET /api/listings?query=...` matches a listing when any of these is true (see `buildBrowseQuery`
in [`src/db/listings.js`](src/db/listings.js)):

1. **Full-text search** on title, description and category, ignoring word endings
   ("textbook" finds the textbooks category). Uses a `search_vector` column that PostgreSQL keeps up to date.
2. **Part of a word:** "mac" finds "MacBook".
3. **Typos in a title word**, using the `pg_trgm` extension: "frige" finds "fridge".

With a search term, results are sorted best match first, and title matches rank above description matches.
Without one, they are sorted newest first.

**Upgrading a database created before search was added?** Either re-run `npm run db:setup` (wipes data),
or keep your data by running this once in `psql` or the Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
ALTER TABLE listings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS search_vector TSVECTOR GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
  setweight(to_tsvector('english', title), 'A')
  || setweight(to_tsvector('english', description), 'B')
  || setweight(to_tsvector('english', category), 'C')
) STORED;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS listings_search_idx ON listings USING GIN (search_vector);
```

### Auctions

A listing with `listingType: "auction"` takes bids until `auctionEndsAt` (at most 30 days away).
Its `price` is the starting bid.

- The first bid must be at least the starting price. Every later bid must beat the highest by
  `minIncrement` (default $1).
- The seller cannot bid. The current leader cannot bid again until someone outbids them.
- Bids lock the listing row (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` in a transaction), so two bids placed at the same
  moment are handled one after the other, never both "winning".
- After the first bid, the seller cannot change the type, price, end time or minimum raise.
- Once a minute, `closeEndedAuctions()` (`src/db/auctions.js`, run from `server.js`) marks each ended
  auction that has bids as `reserved`. The highest bidder wins, and on a tie the earlier bid wins.
  The buyer and seller then arrange the handover in chat. An auction with no bids stays `active`,
  so the seller can extend it or change its type.
- Every listing in API responses has an `auction` field: `null`, or
  `{ endsAt, ended, minIncrement, highestBid, leadingBidderId, bidCount }`.

**Upgrading a database created before auctions?** Run this once in `psql` or the Supabase SQL editor.
It keeps your data, and running it twice is safe:

```sql
ALTER TABLE listings DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS listings_listing_type_check;
ALTER TABLE listings ADD CONSTRAINT listings_listing_type_check
  CHECK (listing_type IN ('sale', 'buy_request', 'trade', 'giveaway', 'auction'));
ALTER TABLE listings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS auction_ends_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE listings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS min_increment NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
  CHECK (min_increment > 0);
ALTER TABLE listings DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS listings_auction_needs_end;
ALTER TABLE listings ADD CONSTRAINT listings_auction_needs_end
  CHECK (listing_type <> 'auction' OR auction_ends_at IS NOT NULL);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bids (
  id         UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  listing_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES listings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  bidder_id  UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  amount     NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS bids_listing_idx ON bids (listing_id, amount DESC);
```

### Email notifications

`src/utils/notify.js` emails people when something happens (using the same SMTP settings as the
verification email):

| Event | Who gets it | Link in the email |
|---|---|---|
| New chat message | The receiver. Only the first unread message in a thread emails; reading the thread re-arms it | The chat thread |
| Outbid | The person who just lost the highest bid | The auction |
| Auction ended with bids | The winner ("You won…") and the seller ("ended at $…") | Their chat with each other |

Notifications never block or break the request that caused them: if email is not configured they
are skipped with a log line, and send failures are logged, not returned to the user. User-written
text (messages, names, titles) is HTML-escaped in the email.

### Payments, photos and Telegram (optional services)

Each one is switched off until its keys are in `.env` (see `.env.example`). Setup steps are in
[`../DEPLOY.md`](../DEPLOY.md). None of them needs an npm package: `src/services/` calls each
service's web API with `fetch`.

- **Stripe Checkout, test mode only** (`services/stripe.js`, `routes/payments.js`). An item for sale,
  or an auction you won, can be paid by card on Stripe's own page. The amount comes from
  `utils/payments.js`. When the buyer returns, `/confirm` asks Stripe whether they paid. The
  webhook (with a verified signature) covers buyers who close the tab. Both call `markPaid`, which
  only acts once, marks the listing sold and notifies both people. While one buyer is checking out
  (30 minutes), others get 409. Live keys are refused.
- **Cloudinary** (`services/cloudinary.js`): signed uploads. Without it, photos go to `backend/uploads/`.
- **Telegram** (`services/telegram.js`, `routes/telegram.js`, `utils/telegramBot.js`). Settings gives
  a one-time `t.me/<bot>?start=<code>` link. The bot (long polling, so no public URL is needed)
  links the chat. After that, every notification goes to Telegram as well as email.

**Upgrading a database created before payments and Telegram?** Run this once. It keeps your data and is safe to re-run:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS telegram_chat_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS telegram_link_code TEXT UNIQUE;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS payments (
  id                UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  listing_id        UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES listings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  buyer_id          UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  amount            NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0),
  stripe_session_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  status            TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'paid')),
  created_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  paid_at           TIMESTAMPTZ
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS payments_listing_idx ON payments (listing_id, status);
```

## API

Send JSON. Routes marked 🔒 need the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (the token comes from register or login).

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | API + database health check |
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | `{ name, email, password, major?, graduationYear? }`. Only `.edu.kh` emails. Emails a verification link; nobody is signed in yet |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | `{ email, password }` → `{ user, token }`. `403` until the email is verified |
| POST | `/api/auth/verify-email` | `{ token }` → verifies the email, which unlocks signing in |
| POST | `/api/auth/resend-verification` | `{ email, password }` → emails a new verification link (the old one stops working) |
| GET 🔒 | `/api/auth/me` | The logged-in user |
| GET | `/api/listings` | Browse and search (ranked, typo tolerant; see Search above). Query: `query`, `category`, `condition`, `type`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `status` (default `active`) |
| GET | `/api/listings/:id` | One listing, with seller info |
| POST 🔒 | `/api/listings` | `{ title, category, condition, description?, listingType?, price?, cashTopup?, imageUrls?, auctionEndsAt?, minIncrement? }`. `auctionEndsAt` (ISO date) is required for an auction |
| PATCH 🔒 | `/api/listings/:id` | Owner only. Any subset of fields, e.g. `{ "status": "sold" }` |
| DELETE 🔒 | `/api/listings/:id` | Owner only |
| GET | `/api/listings/:id/bids` | An auction's bids, highest first, with bidder name |
| POST 🔒 | `/api/listings/:id/bids` | `{ amount }`. Place a bid (see Auctions above) |
| GET | `/api/payments/config` | `{ enabled }`: whether card payments are switched on |
| POST 🔒 | `/api/payments/checkout` | `{ listingId }` → `{ url }` of Stripe's payment page |
| POST 🔒 | `/api/payments/confirm` | `{ sessionId }` → `{ status: "paid" \| "pending" }`, checked with Stripe |
| POST | `/api/payments/webhook` | Called by Stripe only, with a signature check |
| GET 🔒 | `/api/users/me/telegram` | `{ enabled, connected }` |
| POST 🔒 | `/api/users/me/telegram` | `{ link }`: one-time link that opens the bot |
| DELETE 🔒 | `/api/users/me/telegram` | Disconnect Telegram |
| GET | `/api/users/:id` | Public profile (email hidden) |
| GET | `/api/users/:id/listings` | All listings by a user |
| PATCH 🔒 | `/api/users/me` | `{ name?, major?, graduationYear?, bio?, avatarUrl? }` |
| GET 🔒 | `/api/messages/conversations` | My chat threads with unread counts |
| GET 🔒 | `/api/messages?listingId=&withUserId=` | One thread, oldest first |
| POST 🔒 | `/api/messages` | `{ listingId, receiverId, body }` |
| PATCH 🔒 | `/api/messages/read` | `{ listingId, withUserId }` → mark a thread read |
| POST 🔒 | `/api/uploads` | Raw image bytes with `Content-Type: image/jpeg`, `png`, `webp` or `gif` (max 5 MB) → `{ url }` |

Uploaded photos are saved in `backend/uploads/` (git-ignored) and served at `/uploads/<file>`.
Put the returned `url` in a listing's `imageUrls`.

JSON field names match the frontend types in `frontend/src/types/index.ts` (camelCase).
Errors always look like `{ "error": "message", "details": { "field": "message" } }`.

## Security

- **SQL injection:** every query uses `$1, $2, ...` parameters, never string concatenation.
- **Passwords:** hashed with scrypt (Node's built-in `crypto`) plus a random salt; never returned by the API.
- **Verified members only:** an account cannot sign in until the link sent to its `.edu.kh` address is opened, so a
  made-up or borrowed email gets nowhere. An unverified sign-up is replaced if the email registers again, so a
  stranger cannot block the real owner. Every protected request re-checks that the account exists and is verified.
- **Auth:** signed JWTs expire after 7 days; listings can only be changed or deleted by their owner.
- **Privacy:** emails appear only on your own account, never on public profiles.
- **Secrets:** live in `.env` (git-ignored). Nothing secret is committed.

## Progress (week 4)

Done:
- Database schema from the ER diagram, with setup and seed scripts
- Campus-email registration, login, JWT sessions, email-verification flow
- Listings: create/read/update/delete, search, filters, sale/buy-request/trade/giveaway types, cash top-up, sold/traded status
- Profiles and messaging (threads per listing, unread counts)
- Unit tests for validation; all endpoints checked against a real PostgreSQL database
- Frontend connected: login, registration, email verification, listings (with photo upload),
  owner actions (sold / reserved / delete), messaging and profile editing all use this API
- Verification emails over SMTP (Outlook or Gmail), with a resend button

Next:
- Move photo uploads to Cloudinary before deploying (Render's disk is wiped on every restart)
- Deploy (Render + Supabase); then stretch goals: reviews, KHQR, meetup spots, Notify Me, Telegram bot
